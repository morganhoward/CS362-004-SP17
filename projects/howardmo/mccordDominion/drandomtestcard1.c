    Name: Doug McCord

    Project: CS 362 Assignment 4
    Description: 
    "1- Write an automated random test generator for three Dominion cards “the 
        refactored code you created for assignment-2”, one of them being the adventurer 
        card, and at least one being a card you wrote unit tests for in assignment-3. 
        Check these testers in as randomtestcard1.c, randomtestcard2.c, and 
        randomtestadventurer.c.

     2- Submit a pdf file, called Assignment-4.pdf, to the Canvas contains the following 
        sections:
        • Random Testing: write up the development of your random testers, including 
        improvements in coverage and efforts to check the correctness of your 
        specification in a section called.
        • Code Coverage: discuss how much of adventurer and the other cards’ code you 
        managed to cover. Was there code you failed to cover? Why?. For at least one 
        card, make your tester achieve 100% statement and branch coverage, and document 
        this (and how long the test has to run to achieve this level of coverage). It 
        should not take more than five minutes to achieve the coverage goal (on a 
        reasonable machine, e.g. flip).
        • Unit vs Random: compare your coverage to that for your unit tests that you 
        created in assignment-3, and discuss how the tests differ in ability to detect 
        faults. Which tests had higher coverage – unit or random? Which tests had better 
        fault detection capability? ( Be detailed and thorough!).

     3- Add rules to the Makefile to produce randomtestcard1.out, randomtestcard2.out, 
        and randomtestadventurer.out, including coverage results.
